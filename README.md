### What this is.
This is a small JSON REST server I created for a Blog App built [here](https://github.com/OreAkintobi/BlogMe-App "here").

### How to Use
- Clone this repo and open in command line.
- Run `yarn install` in the project folder to install all the required dependencies.
- Run `npm run db` to load the database onto localhost:3005.
- Run `npm run tunnel` to create a temporary link to the server with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/ "ngrok").
- Copy the 'Forwarding' link in the command window opened by ngrok and paste it in `baseURL` part of the `jsonServer.js` file in the api section of the [project](https://github.com/OreAkintobi/BlogMe-App "project") folder.
- Follow the remaining instructions [here](https://github.com/OreAkintobi/BlogMe-App "here") to run the app on your emulator or device.
